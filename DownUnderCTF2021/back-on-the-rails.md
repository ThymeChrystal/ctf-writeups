## Description
We intercepted further communications between the two. This text was sent shortly before we lost track of one of the suspects, with an image attached. Can you work out what they're talking about?

Okay, please promise not to judge me, but I might have ended up catching the wrong train again. Though I think I'm still in Australia this time (at least it isn't like that time in Norway LOL). I managed to snap a picture before we went past this stationâ€¦ you have any ideas where I might be?

Please tell us the name of the station, with any spaces replaced by underscores.

We'll hold off on steganography tools as we're looking for a location and, with this being OSINT, an image search is more likely.

I uploaded the image to [Google](https://images.google.com/) and [Yandex](https://yandex.com/images/), but, on its own, this yielded no results. Therefore, I added some extra search terms along with the original image. We know that the image is of a train station and that it's in Australia. I tried search terms such as:
* station australia
* train station australia
* abandoned train station australia

Finally, I used the image with the search terms `train station australia graffiti` which yielded the snippet of a search result below, where the bottom-left image looks like it might be our station:

<img src="./google-search-pic-botr.png" alt="Google search result" width="500px" />

Clicking on the bottom-left image took me to a news article which included the Google search result picture with a caption naming it as General Motors station:

<img src="./news-article-botr.png" alt="News article" width="500px" />

To check whether this really was the station we were looking for, I did a Google image search for `General Motors station australia`. This brought up an image that closely matched the original image:

<img src="./graffiti-pic-botr.png" alt="General Motors result" width="500px" />

This confirms that the station's name is General Motors, making the final flag `DUCTF{general_motors}`.
