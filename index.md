# Index of keywords for Write-ups
This is an index of keywords from CTF write-ups.

To enable keywords to be added for a write-up, create a title named `Keywords` (e.g. ## Keywords) and follow that with comma separated list of keywords on the next line. Keywords can contain spaces, and will be listed as a single entry. The script to build this index will continue to assume it's reading keywords until it hits another title (line starting with #) or the file ends.
